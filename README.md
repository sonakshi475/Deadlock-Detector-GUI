# MatrixLock: Deadlock Detection Tool using Banker's Algorithm and RAG

**MatrixLock** is a system resource management and deadlock detection tool built with C++ and Python. It provides a graphical interface for simulating **Banker's Algorithm** and **Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)** to detect and visualize potential deadlocks in a system.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Supports both **Banker's Algorithm** and **RAG-based** deadlock detection.
- 🖥️ **User-friendly GUI** built with Tkinter for real-time interaction.
- 📊 **Visualizes** Allocation Matrix, Max Matrix, Need Matrix, and Available Resources.
- 🔁 Displays safe sequence (if available) or deadlock warning clearly.
- 📈 Graphical **RAG visualization** using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
